# Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) Report  
## Component: Servo Motor  
### System: Hiwonder Armpi_FPV Robotic Arm  
### Standard: MIL-STD-1629A  
---

## 1. Introduction

This FMEA report analyzes potential failure modes of the **servo motor** used in the Hiwonder Armpi_FPV robotic arm, as specified in the provided System Requirement Specification (SRS). The analysis follows the guidelines of MIL-STD-1629A and references relevant literature and datasheets to justify each identified failure mode.

## 2. Servo Motor Function

**Function:**  
- Provide precise angular positioning and torque to each joint of the robotic arm for manipulation tasks (FR1.1, FR1.2, FR3.1).
- Feedback position, temperature, and voltage (FR3.2).
- Operate within a 10–40°C indoor environment, with a maximum payload of 500g.

### Key

- **Severity (S):** 1 (least severe) to 10 (most severe)
- **Occurrence (O):** 1 (rare) to 10 (frequent)
- **Detection (D):** 1 (certain detection) to 10 (undetectable)
- **RPN:** Risk Priority Number = S × O × D

## 5. Notes

- The RPN values highlight **positioning error/drift** and **loss of torque** as the most critical failure modes for this application.
- The system’s built-in monitoring and protection features (FR3.2, FR3.3) help mitigate some risks, but regular maintenance and inspection are recommended.
- This FMEA is specific to the educational/indoor use case and assumes operation within the specified environmental and load constraints.
